# GEOMETRICAL OPERATIONS
```
This module helps deal with basic operations on shapes.
There are several types of basic shapes which are:
--> 2D shapes
--> 3D shapes
--> Curved shapes

```
##  2D SHAPES
```
In geometry, a two-dimensional shape can be defined as a flat plane figure or a shape that has two dimensions – length and width. 
Two-dimensional or 2-D shapes do not have any thickness and can be measured in only two faces. 
We can classify figures on the basis of the dimensions they have. 
A triangle, quadilaterals and polygons are examples of two-dimensional shapes. 
We will basically be dealing on mathematical operations that can be done with each of these shapes.
```

## TRIANGLE 
```
For the operations on a triangle, this program would be able to run: Area and the Pythagorean theorem 
[] AREA OF A TRIANGLE 
This finds the area of a Triangle using the formula A = 0.5 * b * h

[] PYTHAGOREAN THEOREM
To find the pythagorean theorem, we would require the input of either the hypotenuse, opposite or adjacent sides from the user
```

## QUADILATERALS
```
A quadilateral is a four sided shape, closed and has straight lines. The types of quadilaterals this program can work on are:
Parallelogram
Square
Rectangle
Rhombus
Trapezoid
Kite

[**] PARALLELOGRAM
This program finds the Area and Perimeter of a  prallelogram
--> Area of a Parallelogram is found using the formula A = b * h
--> Perimter of a Parallelogram is found using the formula 2(a + b)

[**] SQUARE
This program finds the Area of a square
--> Area of a square is found using the formula A = s.sqr

[**] RECTANGLE
This program finds the Area and perimeter of a Rectangle
--> Area of a Rectangle is found using the formula A = b*h
--> Perimeter of a Rectangle is found using the formula 2(l + b)

[**] RHOMBUS
This program finds the Area and perimeter of a Rhombus
--> Area of a Rhombus is found using the formula A = p * q / 2
--> Perimeter of a Rhombus is found using the formula P = 4 * a

[**] TRAPEZOID
This program finds the Area and perimeter of a Trapezoid
--> Area of a Trapezoid is found using the formula A = p * q / 2
--> Perimeter of a Trapezoid is found using the formula P = 4 * a

[**] KITE
This program finds the Area and perimeter of a kite
--> Area of a kite is found using the formula A = p * q / 2
--> Perimeter of a kite is found using the formula 2(a + b)
```

## POLYGONS
```
This finds the perimeter and area of all polygons aside those afore-mentioned 
--> Area of a polygon is found using the formula A = half of the apotem times the perimeter
--> Perimeter of a polygon is found by suming the lengths of all sides
```

## 3D SHAPES
```
In geometry, a three-dimensional shape can be defined as a solid figure or an object or shape that has three dimensions – length, width and height.Unlike two-dimensional shapes, three-dimensional shapes have thickness or depth.

A cube, rectangular prism, sphere, cone, cuboid and cylinder are the basic 3-dimensional shapes we see around us. 
```

## CUBE
```
The basic mathematical operations this program would be working on are: Area and  Circumference
[] SURFACE AREA OF A Cube
This finds the surface area of a Cube using the formula 6 * sides.pow(2)
[] CIRCUMFERENCE OF A Cube
To find the Circumference of a Cube,we use the formula 2 * Pi * r
```

## RECTANGULAR PRISM
```
The basic mathematical operations this program would be working on are: Area and  Volume
[] AREA OF A Rectangular prism
This finds the area of a Rectangular prism using the formula A = 2(w*l + h*l + h*w)
l = length
h = height
w = width

[] Volume OF A Rectangular prism
To find the Volume of a Rectangular prism,we use the formula side1 * side2 * side3
```
## SPHERE
```
The basic mathematical operations this program would be working on are: Area and  Volume
[] SURFACE AREA OF A Sphere
This finds the surface area of a Sphere using the formula A = 4 * Pi * r.sqr

[] Volume OF A Sphere
To find the Volume of a Sphere,we use the formula 4/3 * Pi * r.cube
```
## CONE
```
The basic mathematical operations this program would be working on are: Area and  Volume
[] SURFACE AREA OF A Cone
This finds the surface area of a Cone using the formula A = Pi * r * side

[] Volume OF A Cone
To find the Volume of a Cone,we use the formula 1/3 * Pi * r.sqr * height
```
## CUBOID
```
The basic mathematical operations this program would be working on are: Area and  Volume
[] SURFACE AREA OF A Cuboid
This finds the area of a Cuboid using the formula: TSA = 2 (lw + wh + hl)

[] Volume OF A Cuboid
To find the Volume of a Cuboid,we use the formula: xyz Surface area = 2xy + 2xz + 2yz
```
## CYLINDER
```
The basic mathematical operations this program would be working on are: Area and  Volume
[] SURFACE AREA OF A cylinder
This finds the surface area of a cylinder using the formula: Areas of top and bottom circles + Area of the side
															2(pi × radius2) + 2 × pi × radius × height

[] Volume OF A cylinder
To find the Volume of a cylinder,we use the formula  Pi * r.sqr * height
```
## CURVED SHAPES
Within this, we have the circle and the ellipse

## CIRCLE
```
The basic mathematical operations this program would be working on are: Area and  Circumference
[] AREA OF A CIRCLE
This finds the area of a Circle using the formula A = Pi * r ** 2

[] CIRCUMFERENCE OF A CIRCLE
To find the Circumference of a circle,we use the formula 2 * Pi * r
```
## ELLIPSE
```
For the operations on an ellipse, this program would be able to run: Area, Circumference  and the volume
[] AREA OF AN ELLIPSE
This finds the area of an Ellipse using the formula A = Pi a * b

[] CIRCUMFERENCE OF AN ELLIPSE
"The perimeter of an ellipse is approximately equal to the circumference of a circle the radius of which is the semi-cubic mean of the semi-axes of the ellipse." So therefore, we use the formula 2 * Pi * r

[] Volume OF An Ellipse
To find the Volume of an Ellipse,we use the formula (4/3) x π x R1 x R2 x R.
```

Note: Aside what has been written down on this readme file, the program does not execute any other operation on the stated basic shapes.
